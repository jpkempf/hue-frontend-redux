This project is a work-in-progress rewrite of the equally work-in-progress [Hue Web Frontend](https://github.com/jpkempf/hue-web-frontend). Because rewriting stuff all the time is more fun than actually getting shit done!

It has "redux" in its name because, uh, no reason, really. Go away.

Also, this project makes use of SUPER BLEEDING EDGE FUNCTIONALITY like `fetch`, `async/await`, `Promise`, lots of ES6 stuff and I don't think any of it gets polyfilled. So you'll want to use a SUPER BLEEDING EDGE BROWSER or you probably won't get far. Sorry (not sorry)!

Also also, I do `push --force` up in here all the time, so yeah. You've been warned (like anyone is ever going to check this out or even notice it, haha).
